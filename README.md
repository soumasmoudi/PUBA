# PUBA: Privacy-preserving and User-centric Biometric Authentication through Malleable Signature

This repository contains the proof-of-concept of a novel biometric authentication scheme, called PUBA. The reference paper of this solution will be available soon. 

The code source uses the bplib python library for computations on EC groups and bilinear pairings.
